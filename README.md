# My Homelab Setup

## About
This is my homelab setup. It is ever-changing, but I plan to keep up with my changes and updates here.
I have this lab for a few reasons:
1. Learn Linux at a deep level.
2. Set up and configure Virtual Machines on a Virtual Network.
3. Start practicing with cybersecurity-oriented VMs (etc. Kali and Metasploitable)
4. General system administration and automation.
5. Programming (Bash and Python for now).
6. A place for the random project ideas I come up with.
